# Event Reference

Events can be defined per function level and logically all ECS-based events within the same function will be placed on the same cluster but using different tasks and services. Serverless events in the same function of another task-based event can be useful if you want to share the same VPC or event the ALB with that serverless event, or even have a hybrid function (2 events, 1 task-based and another serverless) in the same function but have each event enabled or disabled accordingly to your environment needs. For example; if you want to cut costs on your development environment you could go all serverless on that by disabling the task-based event on the development deployment through your [env.yml file](../../installation/configure-environments-ivars.md).
