# Runtimes

Runtimes are used at build time to **containerize** your **code** plus the required **dependencies** and a **minimal OS **to be able to run your code as AWS Lambda or any other serverless (Google Cloud functions) would do but running it on a container inside an EC2, Fargate instance or even the Lambda environment itself when using Lambda containers.

It allows developers to specify defined runtimes for quick and easy usage (also most common), so we can jump right away to code, without needing to write resource-specific code, and also allowing to build hybrid environments and scale as your need.
