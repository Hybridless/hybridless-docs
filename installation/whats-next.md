# What's next?

You have reviewed the basics of how to set up a project with hybridless and how to make your hybridless definition on top of serverless. In this [simple example](define-your-function.md), there are tons of hidden concepts and heavy work done for you by hybridless, serverless, AWS \(CloudFormation\) and docker. 

Hybridless leverages all these concepts but it's also always good to know what is being done, so you can extract the maximum of the tools available to you. Please, take your time to read some of the documentation we prepared for you. 

The possibilities are truly infinite, so enjoy it and make good usage! [ðŸ¤“](https://emojipedia.org/nerd-face/)
