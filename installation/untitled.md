# Requirements

Hybridless is directly coupled with the `serverless` framework and therefore is the only dependency required for it to work. All other dependencies for javascript as `webpack` and `babel` for example, are handled and injected by the plugin during the development build and don't affect the total build/image size.

If you are not familiar with **serverless**, please check this [link](https://www.serverless.com/).
