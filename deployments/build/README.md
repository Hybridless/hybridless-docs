# Deployment

Deployments are the most fundamental part of Hybridless because it's the only time it interacts with your **serverless + hybridless** definitions through `serverless deploy` CLI execution and makes its magic ðŸ§™. Also, it explicitly makes prominent one of the **core principals** of **Hybridless,** which is having **all of the resources** required by that application/platform to run defined in a **reproducible manner**, allowing deployments of complex custom cloud solutions easily, by accepting the definition of other AWS cloud resources as simple Cognito User Pools for example, to a cluster of Elastic Cache, with load balancer, VPCs, instances and lambda functions, other than the resources generated by Hybridless in conjunction with serverless.

If you are new to the **Serverless framework** or never heard about AWS Cloud Formation, it's important to remind the importance of this layer, because it's the interface and the controller of all the resources defined on your serverless + hybridless definition and how they are deployed. 

CF has a very extense and verbose set of objects so you can define and configure almost any AWS resource available out there. In the end, Hybridless and Serverless together transcribe a very simple definition language to a very complex set of AWS objects, generating one big JSON file on pure Cloud Formation format that will be used by Serverless to invoke a Cloud Formation Deployment. Cloud Formation will check what has changed from the previous deployment and make the appropriate actions without erasing unneeded resources or modifying anything else than what is needed.

Hybridless bring another set of functionalities that **weren't available** by **Serverless** and neither **Cloud Formation**, which is allowing dynamic containers definitions to be built, managed and deployed on the surrounding of the Cloud Formation lifecycle, granting the ability to have code that is compiled, containerized, deployed and used by AWS resources defined on Cloud Formation.

This flow was fairly common when PAAS was a thing; And making all this possible inside a definition language powered by Hybridless that automates every single deployment process and deploys it on your own AWS account is pretty insane for me. 

## How to Deploy

`sls deploy`

have docker enabled..

### Recommended Approach

buildspec...

build.sh
