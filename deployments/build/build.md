# Build

Build is one of the most important steps of the deployment flow, because we are not just compiling your code, we are doing that but also packing the Runtime and all the additional dependencies into a executable docker image that will be deployed to AWS ECR, and to later be launched and follow the event type core rules doing your business logic.

Bellow is described in detail each step that happens on the build process, before having the actual Docker image that will be responsible for that function in that event-type.
